# Gamescript is an open-standard off which you can base your own scripting language
The goal of Gamescript is to make it "easy" for people that want to make their own programming language, yet "lack" experience and/or confidence.

Gamescript itself is not a language, and no language may be called Gamescript as far as we are concerned (well.. we can't stop you, though you'll miss out on the chance to be listed as a Gamescript langauge).

Really, you could say that Gamescript is a "family" of scripting languages for "games" (though not limited to making "games").

# What must I do to call my language a Gamescript language

1. Open your mouth
2. Make the correct sounds

Well.. there is a little more to it then that. Though really, we don't care if you make a language that is not "technically" a Gamescript language (we are not here to bully). The goal of Gamescript is to provide you with a sort of guide that makes it easier to get introduced with building your own scripting language.

That being said, there are some technical requirements to "technically" being a Gamescript language.


There are a few peculiarities to Gamescript.
1. A Gamescript object is a file
2. A Gamescript object compiles to GPU API code

Now that's pretty much it. Oh, and these..

3. There must be a server
4. The client "owns" the original object file <!-- is it really required to send out (a copy of) the original object file to the server -->
5. There is an "Input" and an "Output" texture/are "Input" and "Output" textures
6. There is a "memory" texture (called the VSS)
7. There are "bindings"
8. The "main" language is "JSON"
9. There are "some" standard definitions (see [default values](Gamescript default values.ods), [definitions](GameScript definitions.odt)) 


# EULA
For a custom Gamescript "compiler" to be recognised, and listed, we require the inclusion of the [Gamescript EULA](EULA.txt)

After "validating" your software, and signing of the EULA, you'll be receiving a certificate from us, which you can include in the software package, as well as an official listing referring to that specific software package.

Note that we don't list proprietary compilers. All listed compilers are free for everyone.

<!-- THIS SECTION IS A W.I.P.
     I MIGHT NEED SOME HELP FINISHING IT
     WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT..
     * ANY USER CAN DOWNLOAD A COMPILER GRATIS
     * ANY USER CAN USE A COMPILER GRATIS
     * ANY PERSON CAN WRITE A COMPILER, PACKAGE IT, AND APPLY FOR LISTING (WHETHER THEY ARE DEVELOPING IT FOR USE IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING/PROPRIETARY USE/EDUCATIONAL USE/"PERSONAL" USE)
